World/Camera movement:

	 - Clicking and dragging is moving (translate) the scene around in the world;
	 - "c" to switch to camera, tis will enable the camera move (translate) in the scene with the arrow keys.
     	 - "c" to disable the camera movement with the arrow keys.

Interaction with the objects:

	b) scaling 
	'x': decrease the width of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'X': increase the width of the shape by a factor of 1.1
	'y': decrease the height of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'Y': increase the height of the shape by a factor of 1.1
	'z': decrease the depth of the shape by a factor of 0.9
	'Z': increase the depth of the shape by a factor of 1.1

	c) rotations 
	The center of the rotation should be the center of the coordinate system of the shape.
	"w": rotate the current shape clockwise about the x-axis
	"s": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the x-axis
	"e": rotate the current shape clockwise about the y-axis
	"q": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the y-axis
	"d": rotate the current shape clockwise about the z-axis
	"a": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the z-axis

	d) translations (using arrow keys) (10%)
	">" (right): move the shape to the right
	"<" (left): move the shape to the left
	"/\" (up): move the shape up
	"\/" (down): move the shape down
	"," (comma): move the shape forward
	"." (period): move the shape backward
